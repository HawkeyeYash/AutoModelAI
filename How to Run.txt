How to run locally:-
Create a Project Folder in your system and name it accordingly.
Download automodelai project and store it there.
Create your python virtual environment in the project folder [Optional But Recommended]
Install required libraries and modules using "pip install -r requirements.txt." [If you are creating venv then make sure the main env has the required libraries also as autogen will run the code there only.]
Create api key from Groq and use llama3-70b-8192 model from [https://groq.com/]. Make a .env file to save the api key there in the main automodelai folder.
In the command line traverse to the main automodelai folder and run the project using the command - "python manage.py runserver".
Click on the generated project localhost link to open the project web application.
