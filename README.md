### How to run locally:-
  1) Create a Project Folder in your system and name it accordingly.
  2) Download automodelai project and store it there.
  3) Create your virtual environment in the project folder [Optional But Recommended]
  4) Install required libraries and modules using pip. [If you are creating venv then make sure the main env has the required libraries also as autogen will run the code there only.]
  5) Create api key from Groq and use llama3-70b-8192 model from [https://groq.com/]. Make a .env file to save the api key there in the main automodelai folder.
  6) In the command line traverse to the main automodelai folder and run the project using the command - "python manage.py runserver".
  7) Click on the generated project localhost link to open the project web application.
